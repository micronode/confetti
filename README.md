# Confetti - project management dashboards

Use Confetti to construct workflows, manage rosters amd monitor operations.

## Overview

Project management and support encompasses a very broad range of software, often involving
multiple applications and processes from issue tracking, to knowledge base to general
communucations such as email and instant messaging. Confetti provides customisable dashboards
for integration and simplified access to these systems.

## Workflows

Service orchestration, support and other interactions with external teams often involve some
manual processing and workflow management. For example, you may need to open a ticket on an
issue tracker, or call an API to register a request. With Confetti you can construct workflow
dashboards that provide a consistent interface and simplification of such processes.

## Rosters

Confetti can manage support rosters via integration with external management systems. With
built-in scheduling you can automate the support team changes, manage leave and generate reports.

## Monitoring

Confetti can provide dashboard for key metrics from integration with external systems. Ingestion
of metric data can be used to construct visual dashboards with complex filtering and charts.
